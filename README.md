# Steganography
This project demonstrates secure image steganography using a combination of AES-256-GCM encryption and Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding in PNG images. It allows users to encrypt a secret message and embed it inside an image, then later extract and decrypt it securely using a shared key.
